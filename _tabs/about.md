## 👋 Hi, I'm Giuseppe

I am a **Senior Product Engineer** specializing in back-end development with a strong focus on **Extreme Programming**, clean code, and scalable architectures. Currently, I play a key role in the Search domain at **lastminute.com**, where I design and maintain systems that handle over **50 million calls per day**.

I am passionate about continuous learning, whether it's mastering a new cloud technology or analyzing football data through scouting methodologies.
