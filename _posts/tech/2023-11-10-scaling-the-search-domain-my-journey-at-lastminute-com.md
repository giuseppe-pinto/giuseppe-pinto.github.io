Since 2017, I have been working as a **Product Engineer** at **lastminute.com**, contributing to the dynamic world of travel technology.

Specializing in object-oriented programming with a focus on **Java** and **Kotlin**, my role involves crafting efficient, performant code and playing a pivotal role in shaping the **Transportation Domain** (Flight, Train, and Bus) of our platform.

## Technical Expertise

My journey began with a commitment to enhancing the performance and functionality of lastminute.com’s transportation services.
* **Core Dev:** Leveraging Java and Kotlin, I’ve been deeply involved in developing and optimizing features to ensure a seamless user experience.
* **Infrastructure:** Beyond feature development, I honed my skills in infrastructural technologies like **RabbitMQ** and **Redis**.
  * *RabbitMQ* facilitated seamless communication between components in our message-driven architecture.
  * *Redis* emerged as a robust caching mechanism, crucial for faster data retrieval and system responsiveness.

## Domain Expertise & Microservices

Within the vast domain of transportation, I’ve undertaken diverse responsibilities. The most significant shift was **breaking down monoliths into microservices**. This architectural evolution increased our platform’s agility and improved maintainability.

Furthermore, I contributed to developing a **transportation pricing engine**, a critical component in providing users with accurate and competitive pricing information in real-time.

## Key Achievements

One of the significant milestones in my role has been **successfully integrating a high-performing partner** into our search engine.
* **Impact:** This partner now generates **30% of total bookings**.
* **Challenge:** It required aligning search and post-search systems and designing a fast, scalable architecture.

Beyond integration, I focused heavily on **reliability and speed**:
* **Scale:** Our system handles a staggering minimum of **50 million calls per day**.
* **Optimization:** In a world where speed is paramount, maintaining low response times is a necessity, not just a goal.
* **Observability:** I worked diligently to reduce incidents by fortifying the robustness of our infrastructure (using tools like Prometheus and Graphite).

## Challenges and Growth

Working in the dynamic travel industry presents constant challenges. I’ve had the privilege of not just addressing technical hurdles but also contributing to strategic decisions. The evolution from monoliths to microservices and the development of sophisticated pricing and rule engines are just glimpses into this exciting journey.

## Team Culture: The Power of Pair Programming

At lastminute.com, collaboration is a daily practice that lies at the core of innovation. We actively engage in **Pair Programming**, a dynamic approach that has proven instrumental in pushing the boundaries of our services.

* **Shared Knowledge:** It allows us to tap into the diverse expertise within the team.
* **Quality Code:** Each line of code is a result of shared scrutiny and instant feedback loops.

As we continue to navigate the complex landscape of travel technology, pair programming remains an invaluable tool, enabling us to deliver high-quality, robust solutions.
